- React is a library
- npm ==> node package manager
- App is a component
- JSX: JavaScript HTML
- we can start and end with <> </> ==> fragment to avoid using useless div
- JSX is fr simplicity, but we can use JS
- props ==> to make the component reusable
- simplest way to create a component ==> JS function
- we must start the component with uppercase letter so react know it's a component not an HTML tag
- props are read-only
- function is stateless component while class is stateful component
- satates are merged
- what applies on JSX applies on components
- effects are side effects on my component
- By default useEffect runs after first render and after every update
- to execute something while unmounting ==> add it in the return of useEffect
- <></> is shorthand syntax for <React.fragment></React.fragment>
- Thus, href="/#" creates a link that, when clicked, takes the user to the top of the homepage or the current page (if already on the homepage).
